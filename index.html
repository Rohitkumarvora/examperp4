Which of the following options can the Agile Team use to resolve the situation?", "options": ["A: Make use of the next Iteration to come out with a team spike that would help determine the feasibility of completing the planned user stories.", "B: Place the stories in the blocked column and work with the Product Owner to remove the impediments.", "C: Proceed with breaking down the stories further in the backlog by working with the Product Owner.", "D: Insert the stories back into the product backlog and wait for a less intensive iteration to work on them."], "answer": "C: Proceed with breaking down the stories further in the backlog by working with the Product Owner.", "explanation": "The chief reason behind not being able to complete a story within one iteration is that the story cannot be broken down into small enough goals. The incorrect options don't address the root cause by waiting or placing them in the blocked column. Also, the Product Owner cannot remove impediments if they are not identified and analyzed. Also, reserving the full team for a Spike is inefficient and bypasses the normal backlog refinement process." },

However, in the fifth iteration the progress has slowed without any apparent reason. What will you do as a next step?", "options": ["A: Work with the team to find the root cause of the issue.", "B: Remove the underperforming team member who is slowing things down.", "C: No action is needed as the team has moved onto norming stage from storming,", "D: No action is needed as the team happened to work low-complexity user stories in the first four iterations."], "answer": "A: Work with the team to find the root cause of the issue.", "explanation": "By completing less complex stories than more complex ones, some Agile Teams want to favor faster progress, Product Backlog Prioritization should be value-based and not speed-based. The first logical step would be to find the root cause of the problem. Also, if there happened to be a low performer, he/she would have had become apparent in earlier iterations. Furthermore, the Team happens to be Autonomous (post-Norming)." },
  { "question": "Question 7: Despite your Team's best efforts to address several blocked items on the Kanban Board, the items remain as is. The Sprint Retrospective reveals that all the impediments can be traced back to a particular Department Head. Tom, the Project Manager had tried to educate the Department Head previously, but the Head is still resistant. Which of the following options should Tom do next?", "options": ["A: Ask the Department Head for Budgetary Compensation that's proportional to the delays due to the lack of their cooperation.", "B: Release an Information Radiator that ranks the Stakeholders according to their Active Support of the Project Goal.", "C: Find other Stakeholders who can help work around the Department Head's barriers", "D: Make use of a Stakeholder Analysis to identify an aligned Senior Stakeholder who could influence the Department Head."], "answer": "D: Make use of a Stakeholder Analysis to identify an aligned Senior Stakeholder who could influence the Department Head.", "explanation": "In this scenario where stakeholders remain resistant despite the Project Manager's best efforts, escalation may be necessary. The incorrect options are wrong because: bypassing the stakeholder does not address the root cause, the Project Manager normally has to resolve problems within an established budget, the root cause is likely to resurface if the stakeholder is bypassed. Furthermore, public shaming by rank does not promote trust and cooperation." },

Secure the team that is coaching on the processes.", "C: Train the team on the business processes in the upcoming iteration. This would help them work more autonomously.", "D: As a Servant Leader, resolve the pending issues while the team attends a team-building event."], "answer": "B: Work with the Process Owners to streamline procedures. Secure the team that is coaching on the processes.", "explanation": "A Servant Leader should work within the organization to simplify processes affecting the team as much as possible. Large companies need internal processes which can rarely be done away with. Expecting all processes to be removed during the time of a team-building event is unrealistic. Training is part of the solution, but not at the price of an iteration. There should be a streamlining effort as well. Story Points help reflect the Complexity of the Story itself. Business processes more accurately reflect an overall reduction of story points over time." },

Minimum Marketable Features are ready for public launch and prioritizing them will help resolve the problem described in the question. Reducing the Team size would not allow accelerating value. Option D may help but you need to prioritize against a specific criteria, which is option B." },

Hence the Product Owner's engagement is critical when considering any scope changes. The incorrect options either violate the Agile principles (full offload) or are unrealistic (extra funding).

If the new scope is urgent then request the PO to terminate the current sprint and go back to the planning stage.", "explanation": "This question is about reciprocal commitment. At the start of the sprint, both the Team and Product Owner committed to each other that PO will not change the scope during the sprint and the Team will deliver the functionality as per the definition of done.

A retrospective meeting is more about lessons learned and you don't define work packages in the product roadmap. You can get approval as per the project management plan but that is more of a traditional predictive approach and not agile." },

Option C is not correct because you always decompose WBS to work packages. Similarly, resource leveling may still impact the project's critical path. Resource leveling is typically used in situations where resources are over-allocated." },

If you have done similar tasks, requirements are clear and you will be doing predictive, but if something is new and you have to try different options, then it has to be agile.

When you use incremental methodology the main goal is to deliver value as quickly as possible. As per the question, schedule compression techniques have already been applied so this means options B and C are already out. You are in the planning stage so you don't need to submit a CR. CR is done once the baselines are established." },
